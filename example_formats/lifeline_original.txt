Verse 1
Em           C
 I have this sinking feeling
D
 Something's weighing me down
Em        C           D
 I am completely saturated
Em             C
 The waves are crashing closer
D
 My feet already drowned
Em         C              D
 Doing the thing I said I hated

Pre-Chorus
Em             G               D    Am
 They've been swimming in the wrong waters
Em           G           D
 Now they're pulling me down
Em        G                D              Am
 But I am clinging to you, never letting go
         Em               G        D
'Cause I know that you'll lift me out

Chorus
Am        Em
Have your way here
G        D
 Keep me afloat
         Am         Em       D

Am        Em   G
Take this ocean of
 D            Am  Em
Pain that is mine
D (ring)
  Throw me a lifeline

Em            C
 I wake up feeling convicted
D
 I know something's un-right
Em             C              D
 Reacquaint my knees with the carpet
Em         C
 I have to get this out
D
'Cause it's obstructing you and I
Em          C                  D
 Dry up the seas that keep us parted

Pre-Chorus
Em                    G               D    Am

 Now they're pulling me down
Em        G                D              Am
